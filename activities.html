					<h3>Camp Counselor</h3>
					<p>In the summers of 2015 and 2016 I volunteered as a counselor at the day camp of my church. My responsibilities included watching over, taking care of, and teaching the children. My first year I was assigned to rising fifth graders. The following year I was assigned to the rising second graders. In the summer of 2017 I was unable to volunteer as I was interning at Berkeley Engineering and Research. Although I had taken a computer programming class at my local city college in the summer of 2018, I was able to work at Camptoons as after-care staff. </p>
