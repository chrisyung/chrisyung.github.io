					<h3>R-Cade Club</h3>
					<p>R-Cade Club meets every Thursday to play video games with one another to relax and unwind after a long week of hard studying. During my Sophomore year, I was third-in-command, helping coordinate events, take roll, and otherwise help out in any way I could. I also designed R-Cade Club's very first logo!</p>

					<h3>iPad Repair Club</h3>
					<p>Although the iPad Repair Club disbanded after my Freshman year, I learned a lot about how to fix Apple devices. It was very interesting seeing how much hardware is packing into such a small device. They really don't waste any space!</p>

					<h3>Knights of Riordan</h3>
					<p>As a Knight of Riordan, I show prospective students around the school, making them feel welcomed and have them experience what it really feels like to be a Crusader. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="NHS">
					<h3>National Honors Society</h3>
					<p>The National Honors Society is an invitation-only club that recognizes students who demonstrate excellence. Being part of this national group, members receive special recognition at their graduation ceremony for being part of NHS. To continue being a member annually, one must accumulate at least 30 hours of tutoring other students.</p>
