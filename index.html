					<h3>Hanson Robotics</h3>
					<h4>June 2015</h4>
					<p>
						During the summer before my freshman year of high school, I had an internship opportunity with a robotics company based in Hong Kong called Hanson Robotics.
						Hanson Robotics specialized in creating life-like robots.
						In preparation for this opportunity, I learned Python and a little Blender for 3-D modelling.
						I had hands-on experience helping to build a prototype robot that was designed to deal cards at a casino.
						This included fitting pieces into hard to reach places on the robot, attaching motors into the 3-D printed skull for facial expressions, and assisting in the development of integrated suction motors that allowed the robot to shuffle and spin cards.

					<h3>Camptoons</h3>
					<h4>Summer 2015, 2016, 2018 </h4>
					<p>
						Camptoons is  at a six-week summer day camp at my church.
						During the summers I would volunteer as a camp counselor, where I taught rising fifth graders (2015) and rising second graders (2016).
						I worked with my fellow counselors in organizing daily field trips and crafting interactive bible lessons for the children.
						I gained leadership and patience through this experience, along with building strong relationships with my fellow counselors through this experience.
						In the summer of 2018, I took a C++ programming course at my local city college, so I did not have time to become a full-time counselor. 
						However, I still wanted to help out and work with the kids, so I volunteered as after-care staff.

					<h3>Berkeley Engineering and Research, inc.</h3>
					<h4>May 2017-July 2017</h4>
					<p>
						In the summer of 2017, I interned at a forensic engineering company called Berkeley Engineering and Research, inc.
						That summer, BEAR had numerous ongoing projects. 
						I was fortunate enough to play an integral role in a number of important developments, including testing the amount of gasoline vapor in gas cans, measuring the voltage of e-cigarette batteries, and even testing how much pressure it takes to make a blender blow up. 
						Although there were many more court cases that I contributed to, I enjoyed 3-D printing and circuit soldering the most. 
						I was able to build relationships with mentors who were incredibly knowledgable in many areas of science, whom I learned much from.
						This experience gave me hands-on experience with a multitude of different disciplines, such as electricity, chemistry, and physics.

					<h3><a target="_blank" href = "#" id = "title_link">This Website</a></h3>
					<p>
						After learning HTML and CSS on codecademy.com, I wanted to put theory into practice. 
						I opted to use Github Pages as a host for the site instead of buying my own domain. 
						It was a little tough at first, but I feel more comfortable with HTML and CSS as a result of this project. 
						Since this was simply an exercise to practice my HTML and CSS, I opted not to use frameworks such as Bootstrap to ensure I understood the fundamentals. 
						As a novice CSS programmer and as someone who enjoys designing things, I am proud of how it turned out.
					</p>

					<h3><a target="_blank" href = "#" id = "https://github.com/yung4/chrisyung/tree/master/DiscordBot">Discord Bot</a></h3>
					<p>
						As an introduction to JavaScript, I thought it would be interesting to create a fun Discord Bot for my friends and I.
						With the typical teenager statement: "I'm tired", comes the classic dad joke response: "Hi tired, I'm dad."
						This bot listens for a message containing "I'm __" and responds with a quippy "Hi __, I'm dad bot!"
						Although relatively simple and rather useless, Discord Bot was my first step into JavaScript and API usage.
						This lead into bigger projects such as my Spotistics web application and taught me skills I would use in future hackathons.

					<h3><a target="_blank" href = "#" id = "title_link">Live Wallpapers</a></h3>
					<p>
						One of the ways I practice my design skills is creating custom live wallpapers for my Android phone using the app Kustom Live Wallpaper. 
						While my wallpapers were aesthetically pleasing when I first started, they were a bit simple functionality-wise. 
						As I become more familiar with the software and its unique programming language, I was able to combine both aesthetics and functionality.
						Since I have been doing this for a while, some of my friends comment on my wallpapers and ask for advice on how to make theirs more like mine.

				<div class = "box" id = "box_4">
					<h3><a target="_blank" href = "#" id = "https://github.com/yung4/spotistics">Spotistics</a></h3>
					<p>
						As an avid Spotify user, I have always enjoyed using third party applications to check my listening habits. 
						However, I always felt as though they were missing something, whether it be aesthetics or functionality. 
						So I made my own version, naming it a portmanteau of 'Spotify' and 'Statistics.' 
						Spotistics is a completely client-side ReactJS Application that aggregates a user's data using the Spotify API. 
						It shows the user what their top tracks and artists are for a certain period of time, their song history, and a breakdown of each playlist by date. 
						This project taught me a lot of applicable skills, such as React App development, NodeJS, utilization of APIs, jQuery and Ajax, Bootstrap, and much more. 
						As a result, I feel a lot more comfortable with JavaScript and web development in general.
